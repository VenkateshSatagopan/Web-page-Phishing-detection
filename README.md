# Web-page-Phishing-detection
Automatically detect phishing web-pages using machine learning

This project is done as part of Datathon conducted by DPHI

Aim: To detect whether a web page is legitimate or phishing based on url attributes(url-length, ip etc..), web-page content based features(number of hyperlinks present in the website, number of redirection links etc...) and some external features (domain age, web page traffic etc..).

The dataset is taken from 

Hannousse, Abdelhakim; Yahiouche, Salima (2020), “Web page phishing detection”, Mendeley Data, V2, doi: 10.17632/c2gw7fy2j4.2

The solution proposed by me achieves 97.08% accuracy on the test dataset and got me first position in the datathon
